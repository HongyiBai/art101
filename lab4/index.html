            <h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
            <h2>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task</h2>
            <p> How to make a home-made pasta:</p>
            <pre><code>
            //Gather ingredients
                //Flour
                //Eggs
                //Salt
                //Water
            //Make the dough
                //Combine flour and salt in a bowl
                //Create a well in the center of the flour mixture
                //Add eggs into the well
                // Mix the flour and egg mixture together until it forms a ball
                //Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes until it's smooth and elastic
                //Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes.
            //Roll the dough
                //Divide the dough into smaller sections
                //Roll out each section using a rolling pin or a pasta machine
                //Cut the pasta into desired shapes and sizes
            //Cook the pasta
                //Boil a pot of salted water
                //Add the pasta to the pot and cook for 2-3 minutes or until al dente
                //Drain the pasta

            <h2>Task 2: Pseudocode a simple computer game</h2>
            <p>How to make a rock-paper-sccissors game.</p>
            <pre><code>
            //Start the game
                //Generate a random option for the computer player
                    //Use a random number generator to choose a number between 1 and 3
                    //Assign rock to 1, paper to 2, and scissors to 3
                //Compare the options chosen by the human player and the computer player
                //Determine the winner or if it's a tie
                    //If the human player wins, display a message that says "You win!"
                    //If the computer player wins, display a message that says "Computer wins!"
                    //If it's a tie, display a message that says "It's a tie!"
                //Display the result of the round
            //Play again
                //Ask the player if they want to play again
                    //If yes, return to step 1
                    //If no, end the game.
            </pre></code>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>It was easy finishing the html file but I had some difficulty creating the pseudocode in details.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I don't really understand how the pre and code tags works but I think it's working for this lab.</p>

        <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>

        <p> The idea of the lab is to create a local file structure on my own computer and add index.html.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p> It was easy creating file structures and making index.html works online but I had some problems with the stylesheet to make the website looks better.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>You are currently looking at the index.html file of this lab and here is the screenshot of the file structure I made.</p>

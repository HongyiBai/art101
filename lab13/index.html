            <h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
            <p>Working with your partner, experiment with loops.</p>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>It was easy to finish displaying the numbers but I had some diffculty on the dashes.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I don't really understand how to make the form to choose the range of numbers for extra credit.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I made a loop to get numbers which divisible by 3, 5, or 7 to 4 different words.</p>
            <h2>Output</h2>
            <p>This is where the output will be displayed.</p>

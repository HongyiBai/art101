            <p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
            
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>It was easy finishing the html file but I had some difficulty on the callbacks.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I don't really understand how to make the callback works.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Go to the console to see the output!</p>

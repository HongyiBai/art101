            <p> Hi folks, my name is Hongyi Bai and I am a game design major student. Ever since I was a child, I have been passionate about video games and their ability to transport players to new worlds and tell engaging stories.  I am excited to learn about the technical and creative aspects of game development, from programming and level design to character development and storytelling. I love experimenting with different game engines and exploring the endless possibilities of interactive entertainment. In my free time, I enjoy playing and analyzing games, as well as drawing and writing. I believe that my passion for gaming and my skills in design and programming will help me create innovative and engaging games that resonate with players.</p>
            <p> Hi, my name is Mingze Li and I am a film major student. I have always been fascinated by the art of storytelling and the power of visual media to convey emotions and ideas. As a film major, I am excited to learn about the techniques and styles used by great filmmakers throughout history, as well as to experiment with my own creative ideas through hands-on projects. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and analyzing their themes and styles. I also love photography and often use it as a means of exploring the world around me. I am passionate about pursuing a career in the film industry and I believe that the knowledge and skills I gain as a film major will help me achieve my goals. </p>
